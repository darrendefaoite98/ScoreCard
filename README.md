# ScoreCard
I am a massive fight fan, the most common arguement amongst fight fans can sometimes be who won a fight that went the distance. 
It's a discussion I'm sure any fight fan has had at one stage or an other. Did Floyd Mayweather really beat Oscar De La Hoya? Did Forrest Griffin
really beat Stephan Bonnar? Instead of writing scoers down on paper which is a bit unfashionable nowadays I decided to create a program which does
all the work for you. If you're someone who enjoys going back over old fights and scoring them yourself then this is the program for you. 
Initially you will be asked how many rounds are in the fight. Then you will be asked for the names of both fighters. Then as the rounds go by
you enter your scores for each round of the fight, in the background this number is added to previous round scores in order to give the user
the final scores. The total result is then printed in which case the user can see who they scored the winner along with the array of scores entered 
which has a similar structure to a judges score card.
